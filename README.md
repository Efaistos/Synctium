# Synctium
Get client information and send them to Discord server.
The interesting part with Synctium, is everything will be sent from client computer, which means it will be anonym.
You can be creative, add screenshot capture, Webcams shots, Password graber and send directly to Discord.
Although this might be **ILLEGAL** if used without client conscent as I said, I take no responsability to what you do with this code. 

# Current features: 

* Use your own token / list.
* Token joins server.
* Token sends message & logs off.
